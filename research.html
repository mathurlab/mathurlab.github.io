			<h2>Cytoskeleton & Cell Morphogenesis</h2>
			<div class="article">

				<div class="section">
						<div class="col_48 flyLeft">
							<p>A complex network of filamentous proteins "the cytoskeleton" is intimately involved in cell division, cell growth and differentiation and sub-cellular, organelle motility. In plants two major cytoskeletal elements are recognized; actin microfilaments and microtubules. The fusion of nucleotide sequences encoding actin-binding or microtubule binding proteins to fluorescent proteins like the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) has made it possible to visualize the cytoskeleton, its functioning and regulation in live plant cells.

							<p>This section provides a brief glimpse into the pivotal role played by the cytoskeleton in cell shape development in higher plants.

							<p>Several reviews have been published on cytoskeletal involvement in plant cell morphogenesis (<a href="publications.html#p22">Kost et al. 1999</a>, <a href="publications.html#p25">Mathur and Huelskamp, 2002</a>, <a href="publications.html#p37">Mathur 2004</a>, <a href="publications.html#p42">Mathur 2006</a>).

						</div>

						<div class="col_48 flyRight bl">

							<p>General observations from a variety of cytoskeletal-drug treatments and mutant cell studies in different model cell types such as <a href="research/modelCells.html#">trichomes</a>, <a href="research/modelCells.html#">root-hairs</a>, <a href="research/modelCells.html#">hypocotyl-cells</a> suggest the following:

							<p>Aberrant microtubule cytoskeleton activity results in a loss of growth directionality. Affected cells tend to grow isotropically and present a generally rounded and swollen appearance.

							<p>Aberrant actin cytoskeleton activity results in lower rate of cellular expansion and produces shorter/smaller cells. Alternatively, as seen in Arabidopsis mutants in different subunits of the ARP2/3 complex and its upstream regulators, cells may develop abnormal regions of expansion and non-expansion to produce randomly distorted shapes.

							<p><a href="research/cellShapeModel.html">A general model</a> has been proposed. Some <a href="research/comparison.html">interesting parallels</a> suggesting high functional similarity between animal cell forward movement and plant cell extension growth have emerged from our cytoskeletal work (<a href="publications.html#p38">Mathur 2005</a>). Amongst the different actin cytoskeleton regulators that our lab is currently investigating is the putative ARP2/3 complex and its upstream regulators, as well as the actin bundling protein fimbrin.

					<div class="col_48 flyLeft br">
						<p>The discovery of the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) from Aequorea victoria and creation of different colour variants has revolutionized biology. The plant cell has become <a href="pdf/2007TIPsJM.pdf">fully illuminated</a>! Extrapolation of observations based on static images is rapidly giving way to non-invasive, dynamic, live-cell studies wherein different cellular <a href="http://www.illuminatedcell.com/">components and compartments</a>, highlighted through various multicolored targeted fluorescent proteins are studied either independently or in multicolour combinations.

						<p>Since 2008 we have created a number of live-imaging probes based on a monomeric green to red photoconvertible Eos fluorescent protein (<a href="publications.html#p46">Schenkel et al. 2008</a>, <a href="publications.html#p50">Mathur et al. 2010</a>,  <a href="publications.html#p53">Wozny et al. 2012</a>,  <a href="publications.html#p55">Schattat et al. 2012</a>). The mEosFP based probes allow tracking of single organelles, observations on interactions between similar and dis-similar organelles. Our lab uses a large collection of <a href="publications.html#p45">intracellular markers</a>, generated either by us or obtained from other labs, for studying organelle dynamics and interactions in living plant cells. These include marker lines for cell-wall, plasmodesmata, general cytosol, endoplasmic-reticulum, endosomes, filamentous (F)-actin, Golgi-bodies, microtubules, mitochondria, nucleus, peroxisomes, plasma-membrane, pre-vacuolar compartments, and vacuoles.

					</div>

					<div class="col_48 flyRight">
						<p>Some of our recent studies using live-cell probes have involved the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton in leaf epidermal trichomes (<a href="publications.html#p23">Mathur et al. 1999</a>, <a href="publications.html#p25">Mathur and Chua 2002</a>), demonstrated actin dependent intracellular motility of peroxisomes (<a href="publications.html#p27">Mathur et al. 2002</a>), elucidated the role of actin cytoskeleton in organelle distribution and cell morphogenesis (<a href="publications.html#p28">Kirik et al. 2002</a>, <a href="publications.html#p29">Kirik et al. 2002</a>), and visualized plus-end extension and behavior of microtubules (<a href="publications.html#p35">Mathur et al. 2003</a>).Our work has extended to rapid subcellular responses and demonstrated that organelles such as peroxisomes respond to transient increases in ROS stress by extending peroxules (<a href="publications.html#p47">Sinclair et al. 2009</a>, <a href="publications.html#p48">Mathur 2009</a>). Other findings from the lab include the behaviour of plastid extensions called stromules (<a href="publications.html#p51">Schattat et al. 2011</a>, <a href="publications.html#p55">Schattat et al. 2012</a>).

						<p>Our lab is presently dissecting the response hierarchy and localized co-operation between plastids, mitochondria and peroxisomes and also between the actin and microtubule components of the cytoskeleton during differential growth in higher plant cells.

						<p>What is a plant cell's initial reaction to different abiotic and biotic environmental stimuli?

						<p>We are using different live-cell probes and a collection of <em>Arabidopsis</em> mutants to document the earliest intracellular responses of plant cells to diverse environmental stimuli. A study by (<a href="publications.html#p54">Sliwinska et al. 2012</a>) shows the co-ordination of  endoreduplication and tip-directed nuclear movement during collet hair development in Arabidopsis. Eventually, the data acquired through live imaging and time lapse movies will be compiled into an exhaustive <em><a href="research/EIRP.html">Early Intracellular Response Profiling of Plants (EIRPP)</a></em>.
