						<h3>Jaideep Mathur<br><i style="font-size:13px; color:#666">Associate Professor: Department of
								Molecular & Cellular Biology, University of Guelph.</i></h3>
						My fascination, for as long as I can remember, has been with &lsquo;shapes&rsquo;. My research
						career has thus evolved around the dissection of mechanisms underlying shape development, or
						morphogenesis, in plants. In 1992, after earning a Ph.D. in Botany from India I moved to the
						Biological Research Center, Szeged, Hungary, to investigate the molecular basis of
						differentiation in higher plants. Soon after I was recruited into the burgeoning field of
						<i>Arabidopsis</i> Molecular Genetics by Dr. Csaba Koncz and joined the Max-Planck Institute,
						Cologne, Germany under the directorship of Prof. Jeff Schell. In this august institution, I
						contributed, as a cell-biologist, to the team effort that led to the molecular-genetic
						recognition of Brassinosteroids, a group of steroidal hormones in higher plants. My time at the
						MPI also coincided with the discovery of the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) and I was part of
						one of the first teams to demonstrate GFP applicability for plant research. In 1997 my research
						took a new direction under Prof. Nam-Hai Chua who introduced me to the delights of the plant
						cytoskeleton and its role in plant morphogenesis. Three years later I had the opportunity to
						work at another renowned plant laboratory, the ZMBP at the Tuebingen University, Germany, under
						Prof. Gerd Juergens. A research-intensive period with Prof. Martin H&uuml;lskamp followed at the
						University of Cologne, Germany. This period resulted in my cloning and characterization of
						several new proteins including the ARP2/3 complex and EB1-like proteins from plants. In 2003 I
						came to Canada and joined the University of Guelph in 2004 at the Department of Plant
						Agriculture. In 2006 I moved to the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, College of
						Biological Science,University of Guelph.
						<p>Research in my laboratory is funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council
							of Canada (NSERC), CFI, MRI, Ontario, and The Keefers foundation, Guelph. An <a
								href="pdf/GuelphMercury.com_gvt_funding.pdf">Early Researcher Award by the Ministry of
								Research and Innovation</a>, Ontario, in July 2008 has provided special funds for
							recruiting researchers. My work focuses on understanding the Cellular and Molecular basis of
							plant morphogenesis. This involves live multi-colour imaging of plants with a heavy emphasis
							on the cytoskeleton and its regulatory proteins, as well as dissection of plant-environment
							interactions. For more information check the <a href="research.html">Research Pages</a>.
