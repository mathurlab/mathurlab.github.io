						<p>1. The initial iso-diametric shape of a cell reflects a regular distribution of internal resources required for the growth process and an overall balance in the internal forces exerted on the cell's boundaries.


						<p>2. The reception and recognition of an extrinsic or intrinsic cue (arrow-heads) occurs on the cell's bounding layers (shown in the magnified transverse-section: from the outside -the cell-wall, plasma-membrane and the cytoskeletal mesh). SPIKE1, ROPs, putative Scar/WAVE-like proteins and members of their regulatory complex are probably activated at this early stage.

						<p>3. The initial responders to environmental cues affect the actin-mesh through the activity of membrane and cytoskeleton interacting FORMINs , actin-polymerization modulating ARP2/3 complex, ADF , AIP1-like, profilins, which cooperate in regional reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton by making it more dynamic and flexible. As the actin-mesh loosens locally the cortical site becomes weaker. Internal forces (such as turgor pressure) can now cause a small protuberance (bulge) to emerge on the cell's surface. Internally (a, d), the loosening of the actin-mesh can greatly facilitate the movement of vesicles carrying growth-material closer to the membrane and cell-wall layers for depositing their cargo.

						<p>4. The cortical weakening caused by the preceding events extends further and depending upon how much it is allowed to extend two possibilities arise; in (b) vesicle movement and assimilation of their contents can become targeted to a region, or in (e) vesicles remain untargeted and deposit their contents anywhere within the cell. Localized vesicle targeting can be achieved in (b) if the cortical-weakening can become restricted through actin-bundling-protein activity with additional reinforcement by endoplasmic microtubules regulated by polymerizing factors, MAPs and microtubule-motors . When microtubules are compromised and unable to restrict the cortical-weakening from spreading (as in e) the result is diffuse, non-targeted growth (e) to produce a globally rounded cell (panel 5). Polarity fixation occurs when both cortical actin-patches and endoplasmic microtubules display concurrence within a region (c). All cellular growth-resources are now recruited to the region for achieving "directional" growth and the development of a specific cellular form.

						<p>While the above schematic depicts a tip-growing cell a similar scenario can be envisioned for diffuse growing cells by making the growth-focus area larger.
