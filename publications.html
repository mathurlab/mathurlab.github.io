                <p>Stromules are tentacle-like protrusions of plastids that have been hypothesized to connect individual plastids and shuttle molecules between them. Schattat et al. (pages 1465&mdash;1477) re-examine this hypothesis using a photoconvertible fluorescent protein, which enabled differential coloring of the plastids in a cell, and directly monitoring the putative transfer of fluorescent proteins between plastids. Using this technique, the authors show that stromules extended by
                independent plastids do not fuse or allow exchange of fluorescent proteins between plastids. The cover image shows the differential coloring of plastids and their stromules in leaf epidermal cells. Chlorophyll autofluorescence is rendered in blue.</p>

                Sporadically, plastids extend and retract stroma-filled tubules called "stromules" that branch and form polygons. Schattat et al. (1667&mdash;1677) visualized stromules and the neighboring endoplasmic reticulum (ER) simultaneously and observed a high degree of coincidence in their dynamic behavior. Their findings open new avenues for understanding mechanisms of transfer and exchange of lipids and metabolites between plastids and the ER. The cover picture shows a three-dimensional

(pp. 1573&mdash;1587) describe several subcellular targeted green-to-red photoconvertible mEosFP probes and discuss their potential applications and caveats. The cover image, taken by Dr. Jaideep Mathur, shows a pair of guard cells from an Arabidopsis plant expressing mEosFP targeted to cortical microtubules. The cells were exposed to an asymmetrically localized beam of
                violet-blue light for creating the range of hues that is achievable through photoconversion of the green form of mEosFP. Complete photoconversion results in red color, whereas orangeyellow shades represent partial photoconversion. Chlorophyll autofluorescence is clearly discriminated from mEosFP fluorescence and depicted in blue.

                Plastid behaviour often occurs in tandem with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dynamics. In order to understand the underlying basis for such linked behaviour we have used time-lapse imaging-based analysis of plastid movement and pleomorphy, including the extension and retraction of stromules. Stable transgenic plants that simultaneously express fluorescent fusion proteins targeted to the plastid stroma, and the ER along with BnCLIP1- eGFP, an independent plastid envelope localized membrane contact site (MCS) marker were utilized. Our experiments strongly suggest that transient MCS formed between the plastid envelope and the ER are responsible for their concomitant behaviour.

              Optimal functioning of a plant cell depends upon the efficient exchange of genetic information, ions, proteins and metabolites between the different organelles. Intuitively, increased proximity between organelles would be expected to play an important role in facilitating exchanges between them. However, it remains to be seen whether under normal, relatively non-stressed conditions organelles maintain close proximity at all. Moreover, does interactivity involve direct and frequent physical contact between the different organelles? Further, many organelles transition between spherical and tubular forms or sporadically produce thin tubular extensions, but it remains unclear whether changes in organelle morphology play a role in increasing their interactivity. Here, using targeted multicolored fluorescent fusion proteins, we report observations on the spatiotemporal relationship between plastids, mitochondria, peroxisomes and the endoplasmic reticulum in living plant cells. Under normal conditions of growth, we observe that the smaller organelles do not establish direct, physical contacts with each other but, irrespective of their individual form they all maintain intimate connectivity with the ER. Proximity between organelles does increase in response to stress through concomitant alterations in ER dynamics. Significantly, even under increased proximity the ER still remains sandwiched between the different organelles. Our observations provide strong live-imaging-based evidence for the ER acting as a common mediator in interactions between other organelles.

              Cell walls lock each cell in a specific position within the supra-organization of a plant. Despite its fixed location, each cell must be able to sense alterations in its immediate environment and respond rapidly to ensure the optimal functioning, continued growth and development, and eventual long-term survival of the plant. The ultra-structural detail that underlies our present understanding of the plant cell has largely been acquired from fixed and processed material that does not allow an appreciation of the dynamic nature of sub-cellular events in the cell. In recent years, fluorescent protein-aided imaging of living plant cells has added to our understanding of the dynamic nature of the plant cell. One of the major outcomes of live imaging of plant cells is the growing appreciation that organelle shapes are not fixed, and many organelles extend their surface transiently in rapid response to environmental stimuli. In many cases, the extensions appear as tubules extending from the main organelle. Specific terms such as stromules from plastids, matrixules from mitochondria, and peroxules from peroxisomes have been coined to describe the extensions. Here, we review our present understanding of organelle extensions and discuss how they may play potential roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis in plant cells.

              High quality transmission electron micrographs have played a major role in shaping our views on organelles in plant cells. However, these snapshots of dead, fixed and sectioned tissue do not automatically convey an appreciation of the dynamic nature of organelles in living cells. Advances in the imaging of subcellular structures in living cells using multicoloured, targeted fluorescent proteins reveal considerable changes in organelle pleomorphy that might be limited to small regions of the cell. The fresh data and insights also challenge several existing ideas on organelle behaviour and interactivity. Here, using succinct examples from plastids, mitochondria, peroxisomes, and the endoplasmic reticulum I present an evolving view of subcellular dynamics in the plant cell.

               Plastids in the viridiplantae sporadically form thin tubules called stromules that increase the interactive surface between the plastid and the surrounding cytoplasm. Several recent publications that report observations of certain proteins localizing to the extensions have then used the observations to suggest stromule-specific functions. The mechanisms by which specific localizations on these transient and sporadically formed extensions might occur remain unclear. Previous studies have yet to address the spatiotemporal relationship between a particular protein localization pattern and its distribution on an extended stromules and / or the plastid body. Here, we have used discrete protein patches found in several transgenic plants as fiducial markers to investigate this relationship. While we consider the inner plastid envelope-membrane localized protein patches of the GLUCOSE 6-PHOSPHATE / PHOSPHATE TRANSLOCATOR1 and the TRIOSE-PHOSPHATE/ PHOSPHATE TRANSLOCATOR 1 as artefacts of fluorescent fusion protein over-expression, stromule formation is not compromised in the respective stable transgenic lines that maintain normal growth and development. Our analysis of chloroplasts in the transgenic lines in the Arabidopsis Columbia background, and in the arc6 mutant, under stromule-inducing conditions shows that the possibility of finding a particular protein-enriched domain on an extended stromule or on a region of the main plastid body is stochastic. Our observations provide insights on the behaviour of chloroplasts, the relationship between stromules and the plastid-body and strongly challenge claims of stromule-specific functions based solely upon protein localization to plastid extensions.

              The recently synthesized isocyanonaphtalene derivatives ACAIN and CACAIN are fluorochromes excitable at wavelengths of around 366 nm and bind cysteine-rich proteins with hydrophobic motifs. We show that these compounds preferentially label tonoplasts in living <em>Arabidopsis</em> and tobacco (<em>Nicotiana tabacum</em> SR1) cells. ACAIN-labeled membranes co-localized with the GFP signal in plants expressing GFP-δ-TIP (TIP2;1) (a tonoplast aquaporin) fusion protein. ACAIN preserved the dynamics of vacuolar structures. <em>tip2;1</em> and triple <em>tip1;1-tip1;2-tip2;1</em> knockout mutants showed weaker ACAIN signal in tonoplasts. The fluorochrome is also suitable for the labeling and detection of specific (cysteine-rich, hydrophobic) proteins from crude cell protein extracts following SDS-PAGE and <em>TIP</em> mutants show altered labeling patterns; however, it appears that ACAIN labels a large variety of tonoplast proteins. ACAIN/CACAIN could be used for the detection of altered vacuolar organization induced by the heptapeptide natural toxin microcystin-LR (MCY-LR), a potent inhibitor of both type 1 and 2A protein phosphatases and a ROS inducer. As revealed both in plants with GFP-TIP2;1 fusions and in wild-type (Columbia) plants labeled with ACAIN/CACAIN, MCY-LR induces the formation of small vesicles, concomitantly with the absence of the large vegetative vacuoles characteristic for differentiated cells. TEM studies of MCY-LR-treated Arabidopsis cells proved the presence of multimembrane vesicles, with characteristics of lytic vacuoles or autophagosomes. Moreover, MCY-LR is a stronger inducer of small vesicle formation than okadaic acid (which inhibits preferentially PP2A) and tautomycin (which inhibits preferentially PP1). ACAIN and CACAIN emerge as useful novel tools to study plant vacuole biogenesis and programmed cell death.

              Chloroplasts are a characteristic feature of green plants. Mesophyll cells possess the majority of chloroplasts and it is widely believed that with the exception of guard cells, the epidermal layer in most higher plants does not contain chloroplasts. However, recent observations on Arabidopsis have shown a population of chloroplasts in pavement cells that are smaller than mesophyll chloroplasts and have a high stroma to grana ratio. Here using stable transgenic lines expressing fluorescent proteins targeted to the plastid stroma, plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, tonoplast, nucleus, mitochondria, peroxisomes, F-actin and microtubules we characterize the spatiotemporal relationships between the pavement cell chloroplasts (PCC) and their subcellular environment. Observations on the PCC suggest a source-sink relationship between the epidermal and the mesophyll layers and the Arabidopsis mutants glabra2 (gl2) and immutans (im) underscore their developmental plasticity. Our findings lay down the foundation for further investigations aimed at understanding the precise role and contributions of PCC in plant interactions with the environment.

              The mitochondrion is an organelle originating from an endosymbiotic event and playing a role in several fundamental processes such as energy production, metabolite syntheses, and programmed cell death. This organelle is delineated by two membranes whose synthesis requires an extensive exchange of phospholipids with other cellular organelles such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and vacuolar membranes in yeast. These transfers of phospholipids are thought to occur by a non-vesicular pathway at contact sites between two closely apposed membranes. In plants, little is known about the biogenesis of mitochondrial membranes. Contact sites between ER and mitochondria are suspected to play a similar role in phospholipid trafficking as in yeast, but this has never been demonstrated. In contrast, it has been shown that plastids are able to transfer lipids to mitochondria during phosphate starvation. However, the proteins involved in such transfer are still unknown. Here, we identified in Arabidopsis thaliana a large lipid-enriched complex called the mitochondrial transmembrane lipoprotein (MTL) complex. The MTL complex contains proteins located in the two mitochondrial membranes and conserved in all eukaryotic cells, such as the TOM complex and AtMic60, a component of the MICOS complex. We demonstrate that AtMic60 contributes to the export of phosphatidylethanolamine from mitochondria and the import of galactoglycerolipids from plastids during phosphate starvation. Furthermore, AtMic60 promotes lipid desorption from membranes, likely as an initial step for lipid transfer, and binds to Tom40, suggesting that AtMic60 could regulate the tethering between the inner and outer membranes of mitochondria.

              Peroxules are thin protrusions from spherical peroxisomes produced under low levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress. Whereas stress mitigation favours peroxule retraction, prolongation of the ROS stress leads to the elongation of the peroxisome into a tubular form. Subsequently, the elongated form becomes constricted through the binding of proteins such as dynamin related proteins 3A and 3B and eventually undergoes fission to increase the peroxisomal population within a cell. The events that occur in the short time window between peroxule initiation and the tubulation of the entire peroxisome have not been observed in living plant cells. Here, using fluorescent protein aided live-imaging, we show that peroxules are formed after only 4 minutes of high light (HL) irradiation during which there is a perceptible increase in the cytosolic levels of hydrogen peroxide. Using a stable, double transgenic line of Arabidopsis thaliana expressing a peroxisome targeted YFP and a mitochondrial targeted GFP probe, we observed sustained interactions between peroxules and small, spherical mitochondria. Further it was observed that the frequency of HL-induced interactions between peroxules and mitochondria increased in the Arabidopsis anisotropy1 mutant that has reduced cell wall crystallinity and where we show accumulation of higher H2O2 levels than wild type plants. Our observations suggest a testable model whereby peroxules act as interaction platforms for ROS-distressed mitochondria that may release membrane proteins and fission factors. These proteins might thus become easily available to peroxisomes and facilitate their proliferation for enhancing the ROS-combating capability of a plant cell.

              Optical highlighters comprise of photo-activatable, photo-switchable and photo- convertible fluorescent proteins and are relatively recent additions to the toolbox utilized for live cell imaging research. Here, we provide an overview of four photo-convertible fluorescent proteins (pcFP) that are being used in plant cell research: Eos, Kaede, Maple and Dendra2. Each of these proteins has a significant advantage over other optical highlighters since their green fluorescent, non-converted forms and red fluorescent converted forms are generally clearly visible at expression levels that do not appear to interfere with subcellular dynamics and plant development. These proteins have become increasingly useful for understanding the role of transient and sustained interactions between similar organelles. Tracking of single organelles after green-to-red conversion has provided novel insights on plastids and their stroma-filled extensions and on the formation of mega-mitochondria. Similarly colour recovery after photo- conversion has permitted the estimation of nuclear endo-reduplication events and is being developed further to image protein trafficking within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. We have also applied photo-convertible proteins to create colour- differentiation between similar cell types to follow their development. Both the green and red fluorescent forms of these proteins are compatible with other commonly used single coloured FPs. This has allowed us to develop simultaneous visualization schemes for up to five types of organelles and investigate organelle interactivity. The advantages and caveats associated with the use of photo-convertible fluorescent proteins are discussed.

              Multi-coloured fluorescent proteins targeted to plastids have provided new insights on the dynamic behaviour of these organelles and their interactions with other cytoplasmic components and compartments. Sub-plastidic components such as thylakoids, stroma, the inner and outer membranes of the plastid envelope, nucleoids, plastoglobuli and starch grains have been efficiently highlighted in living plant cells. In addition, stroma filled membrane extensions called stromules have drawn attention to the dynamic nature of the plastid and its interactions with the rest of the cell. Use of dual and triple fluorescent protein combinations has begun to reveal plastid interactions with mitochondria, the nucleus, the endoplasmic reticulum and F-actin and suggests integral roles of plastids in retrograde signalling, cell to cell communication as well as plant-pathogen interactions. While the rapid advances and insights achieved through fluorescent protein based research on plastids are commendable it is necessary to endorse meaningful observations but subject others to closer scrutiny. Here, in order to develop a better and more comprehensive understanding of plastids and their extensions we provide a critical appraisal of recent information that has been acquired using targeted fluorescent protein probes.

              Mitochondria are pleomorphic, double membrane-bound organelles involved in cellular
energetics in all eukaryotes. Mitochondria in animal and yeast cells are typically
tubular-reticulate structures and several micro-meters long but in green plants they
are predominantly observed as 0.2–1.5μm punctae. While fission and fusion, through
the coordinated activity of several conserved proteins, shapes mitochondria, the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has recently been identified as an additional player in
this process in yeast and mammalian cells. The mitochondria-ER relationship in plant
cells remains largely uncharacterized. Here, through live-imaging of the entire range
of mitochondria pleomorphy we uncover the underlying basis for the predominantly
punctate mitochondrial form in plants. We demonstrate that mitochondrial morphology
changes in response to light and cytosolic sugar levels in an ER mediated manner.
Whereas, large ER polygons and low dynamics under dark conditions favor mitochondrial
fusion and elongation, small ER polygons result in increased fission and predominantly
small mitochondria. Hypoxia also reduces ER dynamics and increases mitochondrial
fusion to produce giant mitochondria. By observing elongated mitochondria in normal
plants and fission-impaired Arabidopsis nmt1-2 and drp3a mutants we also establish
that thin extensions called matrixules and a beads-on-a-string mitochondrial phenotype
are direct consequences of mitochondria-ER interactions.

              Sulfur is vital for primary and secondary metabolism in plant roots. To understand the molecular and morphogenetic changes associated with loss of this key macronutrient, we grew Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seedlings in low-sulfur conditions. These conditions induced a cascade of cellular events that converged to produce a profound intracellular phenotype defined by large cytoplasmic inclusions. The inclusions, termed low-sulfur Pox, show cell type- and developmental zone-specific localization. Transcriptome analysis suggested that low sulfur causes dysfunction of the glutathione/ascorbate cycle, which reduces flavonoids. Genetic and biochemical evidence indicated that low-sulfur Pox are the result of peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of quercetin in roots grown under sulfur-depleted conditions.

              A positive correlation between nuclear DNA content and cell size, as postulated by the karyoplasmic theory, has been confirmed in many plant tissues. However, there is also evidence suggesting that there are exceptions. While in previous reports the cell size:ploidy relationship was studied in intact tissues containing cells of different sizes, here simultaneously developing single cells of collet hairs were used to study endoreduplication in Arabidopsis thaliana mutants that produce hairs of variable size and morphology. Endoreduplication in the root and collet zones of six different root-hair mutants was analysed before and after collet hair development using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Additionally, the changes in nuclear size (ploidy), shape, and movement in developing collet hairs of a hybrid between Arabidopsis transgenic line NLS-GFP-GUS and the rhd3 (root hair defective3) mutant were followed using time-lapse confocal microscopy. In this hybrid endoreduplication in the collet hairs was disturbed. However, based on the analyses of all mutants, no correlation was found between hair length and the ploidy of the cells in the collet and root regions. The results indicate that the karyoplasmic ratio is maintained at the beginning of collet-hair development, but tip growth proceeds in a DNA-amount-independent manner. The final size of a collet hair appears to be dependent more on genetic modifiers governing general cell physiology than on its DNA content.

            <dd class="abstract">Variations in floral display represent one of the core features associated with the transition from allogamy to autogamy in angiosperms. The promotion of autogamy under stress conditions suggests the potential involvement of a signaling pathway with a dual role in both flower development and stress response. The jasmonic acid (JA) pathway is a plausible candidate to play such a role because of its involvement in many plant responses to environmental and developmental cues. In the present study, we used peach (Prunus persica L.) varieties with showy and non-showy flowers to investigate the role of JA (and JA signaling suppressors) in floral display.Our results show that PpJAZ1, a component of the JA signaling pathway in peach, regulates petal expansion during anthesis and promotes self-pollination. PpJAZ1 transcript levels were higher in petals of the non-showy flowers than those of showy flowers at anthesis. Moreover, the ectopic expression of PpJAZ1 in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) converted the showy, chasmogamous tobacco flowers into non-showy, cleistogamous flowers. Stability of PpJAZ1 was confirmed in vivo using PpJAZ1-GFP chimeric protein. PpJAZ1 inhibited JA-dependent processes in roots and leaves of transgenic plants, including induction of JA-response genes to mechanical wounding. However, the inhibitory effect of PpJAZ1 on JA-dependent fertility functions was weaker, indicating that PpJAZ1 regulates the spatial localization of JA signaling in different plant organs. Indeed, JA-related genes showed differential expression patterns in leaves and flowers of transgenic plants.Our results reveal that under stress conditions - for example, herbivore attacks -- stable JAZ proteins such as PpJAZ1 may alter JA signaling in different plant organs, resulting in autogamy as a reproductive assurance mechanism. This represents an additional mechanism by which plant hormone signaling can modulate a vital developmental process in response to stress.</dd>

            <dd class="abstract">Studies spread over nearly two and a half centuries have identified the primary plastid in autotrophic algae and plants as a pleomorphic, multifunctional organelle comprising of a double-membrane envelope enclosing an organization of internal membranes submerged in a watery stroma. All plastid units have been observed extending and retracting thin stroma-filled tubules named stromules sporadically. Observations on living plant cells often convey the impression
            that stromules connect two or more independent plastids with each other. When photo-bleaching techniques were used to suggest that macromolecules such as the green fluorescent protein could flow between already interconnected plastids, for many people this impression changed to conviction. However, it was noticed only recently that the concept of protein flow between plastids rests solely on the words "interconnected plastids" for which details have never been provided. We have
            critically reviewed botanical literature dating back to the 1880s for understanding this term and the phenomena that have become associated with it. We find that while meticulously detailed ontogenic studies spanning nearly 150&nbsp;years have established the plastid as a singular unit organelle, there is no experimental support for the idea that interconnected plastids exist under normal conditions of growth and development. In this review, while we consider several possibilities
            that might allow a single elongated plastid to be misinterpreted as two or more interconnected plastids, our final conclusion is that the concept of direct protein flow between plastids is based on an unfounded assumption.</dd>

            <dd class="abstract"><strong class="abstract-heading">BACKGROUND</strong> Agrobacterium tumefaciens-based transient assays have become a common tool for answering questions related to protein localization and gene expression in a cellular context. The use of these assays assumes that the transiently transformed cells are observed under relatively authentic physiological conditions and maintain 'normal' sub-cellular behaviour. Although this premise is widely accepted, the question of whether
            cellular organization and organelle morphology is altered in Agrobacterium-infiltrated cells has not been examined in detail. The first indications of an altered sub-cellular environment came from our observation that a common laboratory strain, GV3101(pMP90), caused a drastic increase in stromule frequency. Stromules, or 'stroma-filled-tubules' emanate from the surface of plastids and are sensitive to a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses. Starting from this observation, the
            goal of our experiments was to further characterize the changes to the cell resulting from short-term bacterial infestation, and to identify the factor responsible for eliciting these changes.<br />
            <strong class="abstract-heading">RESULTS</strong> Using a protocol typical of transient assays we evaluated the impact of GV3101(pMP90) infiltration on chloroplast behaviour and morphology in Nicotiana benthamiana. Our experiments confirmed that GV3101(pMP90) consistently induces stromules and alters plastid position relative to the nucleus. These effects were found to be the result of strain-dependant secretion of cytokinin and its accumulation in the plant tissue. Bacterial production of
            the hormone was found to be dependant on the presence of a trans-zeatin synthase gene (tzs) located on the Ti plasmid of GV3101(pMP90). Bacteria-derived cytokinins were also correlated with changes to both soluble sugar level and starch accumulation.<br />
            <strong class="abstract-heading">CONCLUSION</strong> Although we have chosen to focus on how transient Agrobacterium infestation alters plastid based parameters, these changes to the morphology and position of a single organelle, combined with the measured increases in sugar and starch content, suggest global changes to cell physiology. This indicates that cells visualized during transient assays may not be as 'normal' as was previously assumed. Our results suggest that the impact of the
            bacteria can be minimized by choosing Agrobacterium strains devoid of the tzs gene, but that the alterations to sub-cellular organization and cell carbohydrate status cannot be completely avoided using this strategy.</dd>

            <dd class="abstract">Transmission electron micrographs of peroxisomes in diverse organisms, including plants, suggest their close association and even luminal connectivity with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). After several decades of debate <em>de novo</em> peroxisome biogenesis from the ER is strongly favored in yeasts and mammals. Unfortunately many of the proteins whose transit through the ER constitutes a major evidence for peroxisome biogenesis from the ER do not exhibit a
            similar localization in plants. Consequently, at best the ER acts as a membrane source for peroxisome in plants. However, in addition to their <em>de novo</em> biogenesis from the ER an increase in peroxisome numbers also occurs through fission of existing peroxisomes. In recent years live-imaging has been used to visualize peroxisomes and the ER but the precise spatio-temporal relationship between the two organelles has not been well-explored. Here we present our assessment of the
            peroxisome-ER relationship through imaging of living <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> plants simultaneously expressing different color combinations of fluorescent proteins targeted to both organelles. Our observations on double transgenic wild type and a drp3a/apm1 mutant Arabidopsis plants suggest strong correlations between the dynamic behavior of peroxisomes and the neighboring ER. Although peroxisomes and ER are closely aligned there appears to be no luminal continuity between the
            two. Similarly, differentially colored elongated peroxisomes of a drp3a mutant expressing a photoconvertible peroxisomal matrix protein are unable to fuse and share luminal protein despite considerable intermingling. Substantiation of our observations is suggested through 3D iso-surface rendering of image stacks, which shows closed ended peroxisomes enmeshed among ER tubules possibly through membrane contact sites (MCS). Our observations support the idea that increase in peroxisome
            numbers in a plant cell occurs mainly through the fission of existing peroxisomes in an ER aided manner.</dd>

Despite its fixed location, each cell must be able to sense alterations in its immediate environment and respond rapidly to ensure the optimal functioning, continued growth and development, and eventual long-term survival of the plant. The ultra-structural detail that underlies our present understanding of the plant cell has largely been acquired from fixed and processed
            material that does not allow an appreciation of the dynamic nature of sub-cellular events in the cell. In recent years, fluorescent protein- aided imaging of living plant cells has added to our understanding of the dynamic nature of the plant cell. One of the major outcomesï¿¼of live imaging of plant cells is the growing appreciation that organelle shapes are not fixed, and many organelles extend their surface transiently in rapid response to environmental stimuli. In many cases, the
            extensions appear as tubules extending from the main organelle. Specific terms such as stromules from plastids, matrixules from mitochondria, and peroxules from peroxisomes have been coined to describe the extensions. Here, we review our present understanding of organelle extensions and discuss how they may play potential roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis in plant cells.</dd>

            <dd class="abstract">The recognition of stromules as sporadically extended stroma filled tubules from all kinds of plastids constitutes one of the major insights that resulted from the direct application of green fluorescent protein aided imaging of living plant cells. Observations of dynamic green fluorescent stromules strongly suggested that plastids frequently interact with each other while photo-bleaching of interconnected plastids indicated that proteins can move within the
            stroma filled tubules. These observations readily fit into the prevailing concept of the endosymbiogenic origins of plastids and provided stromules the status of conduits for inter-plastid communication and macromolecule transfer. However, experimental evidence obtained recently through the use of photoconvertible protein labeled stromules strongly supports plastid independence rather than their interconnectivity. Additional information on stress conditions inducing stromules and
            observations on their alignment with other organelles suggests that the major role of stromules is to increase the interactive surface of a plastid with the rest of the cytoplasm.</dd>

            <dd class="abstract">Stroma-filled tubules named stromules are sporadic extensions of plastids. Earlier, photobleaching was used to demonstrate fluorescent protein diffusion between already interconnected plastids and formed the basis for suggesting that all plastids are able to form networks for exchanging macromolecules. However, a critical appraisal of literature shows that this conjecture is not supported by unequivocal experimental evidence. Here, using photoconvertible mEosFP,
            we created color differences between similar organelles that enabled us to distinguish clearly between organelle fusion and nonfusion events. Individual plastids, despite conveying a strong impression of interactivity and fusion, maintained well-defined boundaries and did not exchange fluorescent proteins. Moreover, the high pleomorphy of etioplasts from dark-grown seedlings, leucoplasts from roots, and assorted plastids in the accumulation and replication of chloroplasts5 (arc5),
            arc6, and phosphoglucomutase1 mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana suggested that a single plastid unit might be easily mistaken for interconnected plastids. Our observations provide succinct evidence to refute the long-standing dogma of interplastid connectivity. The ability to create and maintain a large number of unique biochemical factories in the form of singular plastids might be a key feature underlying the versatility of green plants as it provides increased internal diversity

            <dd class="abstract">Early Arabidopsis thaliana seedling growth includes the highly synchronous development of hairs from every epidermal cell of the collet (the root-hypocotyl transition zone). The dynamics of collet hair growth, and accompanying nuclear movement and endoreduplication, were followed using a combination of different fluorescent probes for time-lapse imaging and flow cytometry. Using laser-scanning confocal microscopy on the double-transgenic Arabidopsis hybrid line
            NLS-GFP-GUS Ã— YPM, there appeared to be a correlation between nuclear position and the cell tip during growth of the collet hair cells, as occurs in asynchronously developing root hairs. However, disruption of nuclear movement in the growing collet hairs using low concentrations of cytoskeletal inhibitors demonstrated that nuclear positioning close to the tip of the cell is not essential for tip-directed growth of the hair. Nuclear DNA content increases from 4C to 16C during
            development of the collet hairs. Following cessation of growth, nuclei moved to the base of the hairs and then their movement became asynchronous and limited. Co-visualization of RFP-highlighted prevacuolar vesicles and GFP-labelled nuclei showed that, whereas small vesicles allowed unimpeded nuclear movement within the hair, transient stops and directional reversals coincided with the presence of larger vesicles in close proximity to the nucleus. Arabidopsis collet hairs provide a

            <dd class="abstract">Many higher plants are polysomatic whereby different cells possess variable amounts of nuclear DNA. The conditional triggering of endocycles results in higher nuclear DNA content (C-value) which in some cases has been correlated to increased cell size. While numerous multi-colored fluorescent protein (FP) probes have revealed the general behaviour of the nucleus and intra-nuclear components, direct visualization and estimation of changes in nuclear-DNA content
            in live cells during their development has not been possible. Recently, monomeric EosFP (mEosFP) has emerged as a useful photoconvertible protein whose colour changes irreversibly from a green to a red fluorescent form upon exposure to violet-blue light. The stability and irreversibility of red fluorescent mEosFP suggests that detection of green colour recovery would be possible as fresh mEosFP is produced after photo-conversion. Thus a ratiometric evaluation of the red and green
            forms of mEosFP following photoconversion could be used to estimate production of a core histone such as H2B during its concomitant synthesis with DNA in the S phase of the cell cycle. Here we present proof of concept observations on transgenic tobacco BY2 cells and Arabidopsis plants stably expressing H2B::mEosFP. In Arabidopsis seedlings an increase in green fluorescence is observed specifically in cells known to undergo endo-reduplication. The detection of changes in nuclear DNA
            content by correlating colour recovery of H2B::mEosFP after photoconversion is a novel approach involving a single fluorescent protein. The method has potential for facilitating detailed investigations on conditions that favor increased cell size and the development of polysomaty in plants.</dd>

            <dd class="abstract">Stromules are stroma-filled tubules extending from plastids whose rapid extension towards or retraction from other plastids has suggested a role in inter-plastidic communication and exchange of metabolites. Several studies point to sporadic dilations, kinks and branches occurring along stromule length but have not elucidated the underlying basis for these occurrences. Similarly, although specific details on interacting partners have been missing a consensus

Co-visualization of fluorescent protein-highlighted stromules and the ER in diverse cell types clearly suggests correlative dynamics of the two membrane-bound compartments. The extension and retraction, as well as
            directional changes in stromule branches occur in tandem with the behaviour of neighbouring ER tubules. 3D and 4D volume rendering reveals that stromules that extend into cortical regions occupy channels between ER tubules possibly through multiple membrane contact sites. Our observations clearly depict coincidental stromule-ER behaviour and suggest that either the neighbouring ER tubules shape stromules directly or the behaviour of both ER and stromules is simultaneously dictated
            by a shared cytoskeleton-based mechanism. These new observations strongly implicate the ER membrane in interactions with stromules and suggest that their interacting surfaces might serve as major conduits for bidirectional exchange of ions, lipids and metabolites between the two organelles.</dd>

            <dd class="abstract">Photoconvertible fluorescent proteins (FPs) are recent additions to the biologists' toolbox for understanding the living cell. Like GFP, monomeric EosFP is bright green in colour but is efficiently photo-converted into a red fluorescent form using a mild violet-blue excitation. Here we report mEosFP-based probes that localize to the cytosol, plasma-membrane invaginations, endosomes, pre-vacuolar vesicles, vacuoles, the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi bodies,
            mitochondria, peroxisomes and the two major cytoskeletal elements, F-actin and cortical microtubules. The mEosFP fusion proteins are smaller than GFP / RFP based probes and as demonstrated here provide several significant advantages for imaging of living plant cells. These include an ability to differentially colour label a single cell or a group of cells in a developing organ; selectively highlight a region of a cell or a sub-population of organelles and vesicles within a cell for
            tracking them and understanding spatiotemporal aspects of interactions between similar as well as different organelles. In addition, mEosFP probes introduce a milder alternative to FRAP whereby instead of photo bleaching, photoconversion followed by recovery of green fluorescence can be used for estimating subcellular dynamics. Most importantly the two fluorescent forms of mEosFP furnish bright internal controls during imaging experiments and are fully compatible with CFP, GFP, YFP
            and RFP fluorochromes for use in simultaneous, multi-colour labeling schemes. Photoconvertible mEosFP-based subcellular probes promise to usher in a much higher degree of precision into live imaging of plant cells than has been possible so far using single coloured FPs.</dd>

            <dd class="abstract">Plants adapt to and survive in some of the harshest environments. Their success can be ascribed to an ability to maintain an optimal subcellular redox environment. Peroxisomes, ubiquitous ROS producing and scavenging organelles in eukaryotes play an important role in cellular homeostasis. Recently the formation of thin membrane extensions called peroxules has provided further evidence for peroxisomal role in rapidly sensing and responding to alterations in
            subcellular ROS. Within a cell the transient extension and retraction of peroxules is asynchronous but takes place within seconds. Peroxules follow tracks defined by tubules of the endoplasmic reticulum and their formation does not appear to involve an elaborate transcriptional-translational machinery. Rather the rapidity of peroxisomal responses suggests ROS instigated membrane modifications aimed at local ROS scavenging or leading to peroxisome elongation prior to their fission
            for increasing peroxisome numbers within a cell. A model on post-biogenesis peroxisomal life-cycle taking cognizance of rapid peroxisomal responses is presented.</dd>

            <dd class="abstract">Plants survive against myriad environmental odds while remaining rooted to a spot. The time scale in which plant cells can respond to environmental cues is seldom appreciated. Fluorescent protein aided live-imaging of peroxisomes reveals that they respond within seconds of exposure to hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals by producing dynamic extensions called peroxules. Observations of the Arabidopsis flu mutant and treatments with xenobiotics eliciting
            singlet oxygen and superoxide reactive oxygen species suggest that the observed responses are specific for hydroxyl radicals. Prolonged exposure to hydroxyl radicals inhibits peroxule extension and instead causes motile and spherical peroxisomes in a cell to become immotile and elongate several folds. Expression of a photo-convertible EosFP-PTS1 demonstrates that vermiform peroxisomes result from rapid stretching of individual peroxisomes while the subsequent 'beads-on-a-string'
            morphology results from differential protein distribution within an elongated tubule. Over time the beads in elongated peroxisomes also extend peroxules randomly before undergoing asynchronous, asymmetrical fission. Peroxule extension does not appear to involve cytoskeletal elements directly but is closely aligned with and reflects the dynamics of ER tubules. Peroxisomal responses reveal a rapidly invoked sub-cellular machinery involved in recognition of hydroxyl stress thresholds
            and its possible remediation locally through extension of peroxules or globally by increasing peroxisome numbers. A matrix protein retro-flow mechanism that supports peroxisome-ER connectivity in plant cells is suggested.</dd>

            <dd class="abstract">The actin cytoskeleton responds quickly to diverse stimuli and plays numerous roles in cellular signalling, organelle motility and subcellular compartmentation during plant growth and development. Molecular and cell biological tools that can facilitate visualization of actin organization and dynamics in a minimally invasive manner are essential for understanding this fundamental component of the living cell.<br />
            A novel, monomeric (m) Eos-fluorescent protein derived from the coral Lobophyllia hemprichii was assessed for its green to red photo-convertibility in plant cells by creating mEosFP-cytosolic. mEosFP was fused to the F-(filamentous)-Actin Binding Domain of the mammalian Talin gene to create mEosFP::FABDmTalin. Photo-conversion, visualization and colour quantification protocols were developed for EosFP targeted to the F-actin cytoskeleton. Rapid photo-conversion in the entire cell or
            in a region of interest was easily achieved upon illumination with an approximately 400 nm wavelength light beam using an epi-fluorescent microscope. Dual color imaging after photo-conversion was carried out using a confocal laser-scanning microscope. Time-lapse imaging revealed that although photo-conversion of single mEosFP molecules can be rapid in terms of live-cell imaging it involves a progressive enrichment of red fluorescent molecules over green species. The fluorescence of
            photo-converted cells thus progresses through intermediate shades ranging from green to red. The time taken for complete conversion to red fluorescence depends on protein expression level within a cell and the quality of the focusing lens used to deliver the illuminating beam. Three easily applicable methods for obtaining information on fluorescent intensity and colour are provided as a means of ensuring experimental repeatability and data quantification, when using mEosFP and
            similar photo-convertible proteins.<br />
            The mEosFP::FABD-mTn probe retains all the imaging qualities associated with the well tested GFP::mTn probe while allowing for non-invasive, regional photo-conversion that allows colour based discrimination within a living cell. Whereas a number of precautions should be exercised in dealing with photo-convertible probes, mEosFP::FABD-mTn is a versatile live imaging tool for dissecting the organization and activity of the actin cytoskeleton in plants..</dd>

            <dd class="abstract">Plant cell expansion is usually attributed to the considerable osmotic pressure that develops within and impinges upon the cell boundary. Whereas turgor containment within expandable walls explains global expansion, the scalar nature of turgor does not directly suggest a mechanism for achieving the localized, differential growth that is responsible for the diversity of plant-cell forms. The key to achieving local growth in plant cells appears to lie not in
            harnessing turgor but in using it to identify weak regions in the cell boundary and thus creating discrete intracellular domains for targeting the growth machinery. Membrane-interacting phospholipases, Rho-like proteins and their interactors, an actin-modulating ARP2/3 complex with its upstream regulators, and actin-microtubule interactions play important roles in the intracellular cooperation to shape plant cells.</dd>

            <dd class="abstract">BACKGROUND: A key event in plant morphogenesis is the establishment of a division plane. A plant-specific microtubular preprophase band (PPB) accurately predicts the line of cell division, whereas the phragmoplast, another plant-specific array, executes cell division by maintaining this predicted line. Although establishment of these specific arrays apparently involves intracellular repolarization events that focus cellular resources to a division site, it still
            remains unclear how microtubules position the cell division planes. Here we study GFP-AtEB1 decorated microtubule plus-ends to dissect events at the division plane. RESULTS: Early mitotic events included guided growth of endoplasmic microtubules (EMTs) towards the PPB site and their coincident localization with endocytic vesicles. Consequently, an endosomal belt lay in close proximity to the microtubular PPB at its maturation and was maintained during spindle formation. During
            cytokinesis, EMTs radiated from the former spindle poles in a geometrical conformation correlating with cell-plate navigation and tilt-correction. Naphthylphtalamic acid (NPA), an inhibitor of polar auxin efflux, caused abnormal PPBs and shifted division planes. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations reveal a spatio-temporal link between microtubules and intracellular polarization essential for localized endocytosis and precise establishment of the division plane in plants. Additionally,
            they implicate the growth regulator, auxin, in this important cellular event.</dd>

The recent identification of different subunit-homologs suggests the existence of a functional ARP2/3 complex in higher plants. Mutations in some of the subunits have revealed a pivotal role for the complex in determining the shape of walled cells and focused attention on the
            interlinked processes of cortical-actin organization, growth-site selection, organelle motility and actin-microtubule interactions during plant cell morphogenesis. The findings supporting a global conservation of molecular mechanisms for membrane protrusion have been further strengthened by the identification of plant homologs of upstream regulators of the complex such as PIR121, NAP125 and HSPC300. As discussed here, the recent studies suggest that there might be hitherto

              <p>In Arabidopsis, based on the randomly misshapen phenotype of leaf epidermal trichomes, eight genes have been grouped into a 'DISTORTED' class. Three of the DIS genes, WURM, DISTORTED1 and CROOKED have been cloned recently and encode the ARP2, ARP3 and ARPC5 subunits respectively, of a conserved actin modulating ARP2/3 complex. Here we identify a fourth gene, DISTORTED2 as the Arabidopsis homolog of the ARPC2 subunit of the ARP2/3 complex. Like other mutants in the complex dis2
              trichomes also display supernumerary, randomly localized cortical actin patches. In addition dis2 trichomes possess abnormally clustered endoplasmic microtubules near sites of actin aggregation. Since microtubules are strongly implicated in the establishment and maintenance of growth directionality in higher plants our observations of aberrant microtubule clustering in dis2 trichomes suggests a convincing explanation for the randomly distorted trichome phenotype in dis mutants. In
              addition, the close proximity of microtubule clusters to the arbitrarily dispersed cortical actin patches in the dis mutants provides fresh insights into cytoskeletal interactions leading us to suggest that in higher plants microtubule arrangements directed towards the establishment and maintenance of polar growth-directionality are guided by cortical actin behavior and organization.</p>

              <p>A group of microtubule-associated proteins called +TIPs (plus end tracking proteins), including EB1 family proteins, label growing microtubule ends specifically in diverse organisms and are implicated in spindle dynamics, chromosome segregation, and directing microtubules toward cortical sites. Here, we report three new EB1-like proteins from Arabidopsis and provide the intracellular localization for AtEB1, which differs from all known EB1 proteins in having a very long acidic
              C-terminal tail. In marked contrast to other EB1 proteins, the GFP-AtEB1 fusion protein localizes not only to microtubule plus ends but also to motile, pleiomorphic tubulovesicular membrane networks that surround other organelles and frequently merge with the endoplasmic reticulum. AtEB1 behavior thus resembles that of +TIPs, such as the cytoplasmic linker protein CLIP-170, that are known to associate with and pull along membrane tubules in animal systems but for which homologs
              have not been identified in plants. In addition, though EB1 proteins are believed to stabilize microtubules, a different behavior is observed for AtEB1 where instead of stabilizing a microtubule it localizes to already stabilized regions on a microtubule. The dual localization pattern of AtEB1 suggests links between microtubule plus end dynamics and endomembrane organization during polarized growth of plant cells.</p>

              <p>The generation of a specific cell shape requires differential growth, whereby specific regions of the cell expand more relative to others. The Arabidopsis crooked mutant exhibits aberrant cell shapes that develop because of mis-directed expansion, especially during a rapid growth phase. GFP-aided visualization of the F-actin cytoskeleton and the behavior of subcellular organelles in different cell-types in crooked and wild-type Arabidopsis revealed that localized expansion is
              promoted in cellular regions with fine F-actin arrays but is restricted in areas that maintain dense F-actin. This suggested that a spatiotemporal distinction between fine versus dense F-actin in a growing cell could determine the final shape of the cell. CROOKED was molecularly identified as the plant homolog of ARPC5, the smallest sub-unit of the ARP2/3 complex that in other organisms is renowned for its role in creating dendritic arrays of fine F-actin. Rescue of crooked
              phenotype by the human ortholog provides the first molecular evidence for the presence and functional conservation of the complex in higher plants. Our cell-biological and molecular characterization of CROOKED suggests a general actin-based mechanism for regulating differential growth and generating cell shape diversity.</p>

              <p>ACTIN-RELATED PROTEINS 2 and 3 form the major subunits of the ARP2/3 complex, which is known as an important regulator of actin organization in diverse organisms. Here, we report that two genes, WURM and DISTORTED1, which are important for cell shape control in Arabidopsis, encode the plant ARP2 and ARP3 orthologs, respectively. Mutations in these genes result in misdirected expansion of various cell types: trichome expansion is randomized, pavement cells fail to produce lobes,
              hypocotyl cells curl out of the normal epidermal plane, and root hairs are sinuous. At the subcellular level, cell shape changes are linked to severe filamentous actin aggregation and compromised vacuole fusion. Because all seven subunits of the ARP2/3 complex are present in plants, our data indicate that this complex may play a pivotal role during plant cell morphogenesis.</p>

              <p>The control of the directionality of cell expansion was investigated using a class of eight genes, the so-called DISTORTED (DIS) genes, that are required for proper expansion of leaf trichomes in Arabidopsis thaliana. By tracing the separation of latex beads placed on the trichome surface, we demonstrate that trichomes grow by diffuse rather than tip growth, and that in dis mutants deviations from the normal orientation of growth can occur in all possible directions. We could
              not detect any differences in intracellular organization between wild-type and dis-group mutants by electron microscopy. The analysis of double mutants showed that although the expression of the dis phenotype is generally independent of branching and endoreduplication, dis mutations act synthetically in combination lesions in the ZWI gene, which encodes a kinesin motor protein. Using a MAP4:GFP marker line, we show that the organization of cortical microtubules is affected in
              dis-group mutants. The finding that most dis-group mutants have actin defects suggested to us that actin is involved in organizing the orientation of microtubules. By analyzing the microtubule organization in plants treated with drugs that bind to actin, we verified that actin is involved in the positioning of cortical microtubules and thereby in plant cell expansion.</p>

              <p>Here, we analyze the STICHEL (STI) gene, which plays an important role in the regulation of branch number of the unicellular trichomes in Arabidopsis. We have isolated the STI locus by positional cloning and confirmed the identity by sequencing seven independent sti alleles. The STI gene encodes a protein of 1,218 amino acid residues containing a domain with sequence similarity to the ATP-binding eubacterial DNA-polymerase III gamma-subunits. Because endoreduplication was found
              to be normal in sti mutants the molecular function of STI in cell morphogenesis is not linked to DNA replication and, therefore, postulated to represent a novel pathway. Northern-blot analysis shows that STI is expressed in all organs suggesting that STI function is not trichome specific. The analysis of sti alleles and transgenic lines overexpressing STI suggests that STI regulates branching in a dosage-dependent manner.</p>

              <p>Microtubules and microfilaments play important roles in cell morphogenesis. The picture emerging from drug studies and molecular-genetic analyses of mutant higher plants defective in cell morphogenesis shows that the roles played by them remain the same in both tip-growing and diffuse-growing cells. Microtubules are important for establishing and maintaining growth polarity whereas actin microfilaments deliver the materials required for growth to specified sites. The recent
              cloning of several cell morphogenesis genes has revealed that conserved mechanisms as well as novel signal transduction pathways spatially organize the plant cytoskeleton.</p>

              <p>The biogenesis of microtubules comprises several steps, including the correct folding of alpha- and beta-tubulin and heterodimer formation. In vitro studies and the genetic analysis in yeast revealed that, after translation, alpha- and beta-tubulin are processed by several chaperonins and microtubule-folding cofactors (TFCs) to produce assembly-competent alpha-/beta-tubulin heterodimers. One of the TFCs, TFC-C, does not exist in yeast, and a potential function of TFC-C is thus
              based only on the biochemical analysis. In this study and in a very recently published study by Steinborn and coworkers, the analysis of the Arabidopsis porcino (por) mutant has shown that TFC-C is important for microtubule function in vivo. The predicted POR protein shares weak amino acid similarity with the human TFC-C (hTFC-C). Our finding that hTFC-C under the control of the ubiquitously expressed 35S promoter can rescue the por mutant phenotype shows that the POR gene encodes
              the Arabidopsis ortholog of hTFC-C. The analysis of plants carrying a GFP:POR fusion construct showed that POR protein is localized in the cytoplasm and is not associated with microtubules. While, in por mutants, microtubule density was indistinguishable from wild-type, their organization was affected.</p>

              <p>The control of the stoichiometric balance of alpha- and beta-tubulin is important during microtubule biogenesis. This process involves several tubulin-folding cofactors (TFCs), of which only TFC A is not essential in mammalian in vitro systems or in vivo in yeast. Here, we show that the TFC A gene is important in vivo in plants. The Arabidopsis gene KIESEL (KIS) shows sequence similarity to the TFC A gene. Expression of the mouse TFC A gene under the control of the 35S promoter
              rescues the kis mutation, indicating that KIS is the Arabidopsis ortholog of TFC A. kis plants exhibit a range of defects similar to the phenotypes associated with impaired microtubule function: plants are reduced in size and show meiotic defects, cell division is impaired, and trichomes are bulged and less branched. Microtubule density was indistinguishable from that of the wild type, but microtubule organization was affected in trichomes and hypocotyl cells of dark-grown kis
              plants. The kis phenotype was rescued by overexpression of an alpha-tubulin, indicating that KIS is involved in the control of the correct balance of alpha- and beta-tubulin monomers.</p>

              <p>Peroxisomes were visualized in living plant cells using a yellow fluorescent protein tagged with a peroxisomal targeting signal consisting of the SKL motif. Simultaneous visualization of peroxisomes and microfilaments/microtubules was accomplished in onion (Allium cepa) epidermal cells transiently expressing the yellow fluorescent protein-peroxi construct, a green fluorescent protein-mTalin construct that labels filamentous-actin filaments, and a green fluorescent
              protein-microtubule-binding domain construct that labels microtubules. The covisualization of peroxisomes and cytoskeletal elements revealed that, contrary to the reports from animal cells, peroxisomes in plants appear to associate with actin filaments and not microtubules. That peroxisome movement is actin based was shown by pharmacological studies. For this analysis we used onion epidermal cells and various cell types of Arabidopsis including trichomes, root hairs, and root
              cortex cells exhibiting different modes of growth. In transient onion epidermis assay and in transgenic Arabidopsis plants, an interference with the actin cytoskeleton resulted in progressive loss of saltatory movement followed by the aggregation and a complete cessation of peroxisome motility within 30 min of drug application. Microtubule depolymerization or stabilization had no effect.</p>

              <p>Plant water homeostasis is maintained by the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA), which triggers stomatal pore closure in response to drought stress. We identified the Arabidopsis small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) protein AtRac1 as a central component in the ABA-mediated stomatal closure process. ABA treatment induced inactivation of AtRac GTPases and disruption of the guard cell actin cytoskeleton. In contrast, in the ABA-insensitive mutant abi1&mdash;1, which is impaired in
              stomatal closure, neither AtRac inactivation nor actin cytoskeleton disruption was observed on ABA treatment. These observations indicate that AtRac1 inactivation is a limiting step in the ABA&mdash;ignaling cascade leading to stomatal closure. Consistent with these findings, expression of a dominant-positive mutant of AtRac1 blocked the ABA-mediated effects on actin cytoskeleton and stomatal closure in wild-type plants, whereas expression of a dominant-negative AtRac1 mutant
              recapitulated the ABA effects in the absence of the hormone. Moreover, the dominant-negative form of AtRac1 could also restore stomatal closure in abi1-1. These results define AtRac1 as a central element for plant adaptation to drought.</p>

              <p>The single-cell trichomes in wild-type Arabidopsis are either unbranched or have two to five branches. Using transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing a green fluorescent protein-microtubule-associated protein4 fusion protein, which decorates the microtubular cytoskeleton, we observed that during trichome branching, microtubules reorient with respect to the longitudinal growth axis. Considering branching to be a localized microtubule-dependent growth reorientation event, we
              investigated the effects of microtubule-interacting drugs on branch induction in trichomes. In unbranched trichomes of the mutant stichel, a change in growth directionality, closely simulating branch initiation, could be elicited by a short treatment with paclitaxel, a microtubule-stabilizing drug, but not with microtubule-disrupting drugs. The growth reorientation appeared to be linked to increased microtubule stabilization and to aster formation in the treated trichomes.
              Taxol-induced microtubule stabilization also led to the initiation of new branch points in the zwichel mutant of Arabidopsis, which is defective in a kinesin-like microtubule motor protein and possesses trichomes that are less branched. Our observations suggest that trichome cell branching in Arabidopsis might be mediated by transiently stabilized microtubular structures, which may form a component of a multiprotein complex required to reorient freshly polymerizing microtubules
              into new growth directions.</p>

              <p>Plant root hair formation is initiated when specialized elongating root epidermis cells (trichoblasts) assemble distinct domains at the plasma membrane/cell wall cell periphery complexes facing the root surface. These localities show accumulation of expansin and progressively transform into tip-growing root hair apices. Experimentation showed that trichoblasts made devoid of microtubules (MTs) were unaffected in root hair formation, whereas those depleted of F-actin by the
              G-actin sequestering agent latrunculin B had their root hair formation blocked after the bulge formation stage. In accordance with this, MTs are naturally depleted from early outgrowing bulges in which dense F-actin meshworks accumulate. These F-actin caps remain associated with tips of emerging and growing root hairs. Constitutive expression of the GFP-mouse talin fusion protein in transgenic Arabidopsis, which visualizes all classes of F-actin in a noninvasive mode, allowed in
              vivo confirmation of the presence of distinct F-actin meshworks within outgrowing bulges and at tips of young root hairs. Profilin accumulates, at both the protein and the mRNA levels, within F-actin-enriched bulges and at tips of emerging hairs. ER-based calreticulin and HDEL proteins also accumulate within outgrowing bulges and remain enriched at tips of emerging hairs. All this suggests that installation of the actin-based tip growth machinery takes place only after
              expansin-associated bulge formation and requires assembly of profilin-supported dynamic F-actin meshworks.</p>

              <p>Arabidopsis thaliana trichomes provide an attractive model system to dissect molecular processes involved in the generation of shape and form in single cell morphogenesis in plants. We have used transgenic Arabidopsis plants carrying a GFP-talin chimeric gene to analyze the role of the actin cytoskeleton in trichome cell morphogenesis. We found that during trichome cell development the actin microfilaments assumed an increasing degree of complexity from fine filaments to thick,
              longitudinally stretched cables. Disruption of the F-actin cytoskeleton by actin antagonists produced distorted but branched trichomes which phenocopied trichomes of mutants belonging to the 'distorted' class. Subsequent analysis of the actin cytoskeleton in trichomes of the distorted mutants, alien, crooked, distorted1, gnarled, klunker and wurm uncovered actin organization defects in each case. Treatments of wild-type seedlings with microtubule-interacting drugs elicited a
              radically different trichome phenotype characterized by isotropic growth and a severe inhibition of branch formation; these trichomes did not show defects in actin cytoskeleton organization. A normal actin cytoskeleton was also observed in trichomes of the zwichel mutant which have reduced branching. ZWICHEL, which was previously shown to encode a kinesin-like protein is thought to be involved in microtubule-linked processes. Based on our results we propose that microtubules
              establish the spatial patterning of trichome branches whilst actin microfilaments elaborate and maintain the overall trichome pattern during development.</p>

              <p>The Arabidopsis CPD gene encodes a cytochrome P450 steroid side-chain hydroxylase (CYP90) that plays an essential role in the biosynthesis of the plant hormone brassinolide. Expression of the CPD gene is confined to cotyledons and leaf primordia in etiolated seedlings and detectable in the adaxial parenchyma of expanding leaves in light-grown plants. Transcription of the CPD gene is not affected by the plant growth factors auxin, ethylene, gibberellin, cytokinin, jasmonic acid
              and salicylic acid, but is specifically down-regulated by brassinolide in both dark and light. Steady-state mRNA levels of a CPD promoter-driven uidA reporter gene correlate with the expression of resident CPD gene in transgenic plants. Intermediates of the early and late C-6 oxidation pathways of brassinolide, carrying C-22 and C-23 side-chain hydroxyls, efficiently inhibit the activity of the CPD promoter. Repression of CPD transcription by brassinosteroids is sensitive to the
              protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, indicating a requirement for de novo synthesis of a regulatory factor.</p>

              <p>The epidermis of Arabidopsis wild-type primary roots, in which some cells grow hairs and others remain hairless in a position-dependent manner, has become an established model system to study cell differentiation. Here we present a molecular analysis of the RHL1 (ROOT HAIRLESS 1) gene that, if mutated, prevents the formation of hairs on primary roots and causes a seedling lethal phenotype. We have cloned the RHL1 gene by use of a T-DNA-tagged mutant and found that it encodes a
              protein that appears to be plant specific. The predicted RHL1 gene product is a small hydrophilic protein (38.9 kD) containing putative nuclear localization signals and shows no significant homology to any known amino acid sequence. We demonstrate that a 78-amino-acid sequence at its amino terminus is capable of directing an RHL1-GFP fusion protein to the nucleus. The RHL1 transcript is present throughout the wild-type plant and in suspension culture cells, but in very low
              amounts, suggesting a regulatory function for the RHL1 protein. Structural evidence suggests a role for the RHL1 gene product in the nucleolus. We have examined the genetic relationship between RHL1 and GL2, an inhibitor of root hair initiation in non-hair cells. Our molecular and genetic data with double mutants, together with the expression analysis of a GL2 promoter-GUS reporter gene construct, indicate that the RHL1 gene acts independently of GL2.</p>

Expression of GFP was only observed with a mutated cDNA, from which a recently described cryptic splice site had been removed. However, detectable levels of green fluorescence were only emitted from a small number of protoplasts. Therefore, other mutations in the GFP cDNA
              leading to single-amino acid exchanges in the chromophore region, which had been previously studied in Escherichia coli, were tested in order to improve the sensitivity of this marker protein. Of the mutations tested so far, the exchange of GFP amino acid tyrosine 66 to histidine (Y66H) led to detection of blue fluorescence in plant protoplasts, while the exchange of amino acid serine 65 to cysteine (S65C) and threonine (S65T) increased the intensity of green fluorescence
              drastically, thereby significantly raising the detection level for GFP. For GFP S65C, the detectable number of green fluorescing tobacco (BY-2) protoplasts was raised up to 19-fold, while the fluorimetricly determined fluorescence was raised by at least 2 orders of magnitude.</p>

              <p>Spodoptera species, representing widespread polyphagous insect pests, are resistant to Bacillus thuringiensis -endotoxins used thus far as insecticides in transgenic plants. Here we describe the chemical synthesis of a cryIC gene by a novel template directed ligation-PCR method. This simple and economical method to construct large synthetic genes can be used when routine resynthesis of genes is required. Chemically phosphorylated adjacent oligonucleotides of the gene to be
              synthesized are assembled and ligated on a single-stranded, partially homologous template derived from a wild-type gene (cryIC in our case) by a thermostable Pfu DNA ligase using repeated cycles of melting, annealing, and ligation. The resulting synthetic DNA strands are selectively amplified by PCR with short specific flanking primers that are complementary only to the new synthetic DNA. Optimized expression of the synthetic cryIC gene in alfalfa and tobacco results in the
              production of 0.01-0.2% of total soluble proteins as CryIC toxin and provides protection against the Egyptian cotton leafworm (Spodoptera littoralis) and the beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua). To facilitate selection and breeding of Spodoptera-resistant plants, the cryIC gene was linked to a pat gene, conferring resistance to the herbicide BASTA.</p>

              <p>Photo-convertible fluorescent proteins are a recent addition to the cell biological tool box available to plant biologists. Here, we provide a brief overview of the use of green-to-red photo-convertible proteins such as monomeric EosFP, Kaede and Dendra2 for understanding subcellular behaviour in plants. A general description of the differential colouring technique using mEosFP for discriminating within an organelle population and tracking interactions between similar
              organelles is provided. This review aims to provide baseline standards and guidelines for pursuing studies using these novel proteins.</p>

            <dd class="abstract">
              <p>Numerous subcellular-targeted probes have been created using a monomeric green-to-red photoconvertible Eos fluorescent protein for understanding the growth and development of plants. These probes can be used to create color-based differentiation between similar cells, differentially label organelle subpopulations, and track subcellular structures and their interactions. Both green and red fluorescent forms of mEosFP are stable and compatible with single colored FPs.
              Differential highlighting using mEosFP probes greatly increases spatiotemporal precision during live imaging.</p>

            <dd class="abstract">
              <p>The plant is a supracellular organism whose cells are locked in position through shared walls but maintain apoplastic and symplastic connectivity. Their fixed position places each cell into a unique niche within the organism. Consequently, every environmental cue is perceived slightly differently by each cell. The response of each plant cell varies accordingly. Thus, plant growth and development reflect a progression of accommodative arrangements reached between constituent
              cells. In recent years the actin cytoskeleton, through its direct involvement in subcellular compartmentation, organelle and vesicle trafficking, and structural reinforcement, has emerged as a key player during accommodative growth and development. Here, using salient actin-cytoskeleton-associated cellular phenotypes, we elaborate upon the molecular-cell biological machinery involved in organizing the actin cytoskeleton during cell shape development in plants.</p>

              <p>Plants lack the Rho and Rac/Cdc42 GTPases that are so important in diverse signal transduction processes in animals. A plant-specific group of Rho-like proteins - Rops - shows striking similarities to their animal relatives, but also exciting differences in their regulation and signal transduction.</p>
