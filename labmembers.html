                            My fascination, for as long as I can remember, has been with &lsquo;shapes&rsquo;. My research career has thus evolved around the dissection of mechanisms underlying shape development, or morphogenesis, in plants. In 1992, after earning a Ph.D. in Botany from India I moved to the Biological Research Center, Szeged, Hungary, to investigate the molecular basis of differentiation in higher plants. Soon after I was recruited into the burgeoning field of Arabidopsis Molecular Genetics by Dr. Csaba Koncz and joined the Max-Planck Institute, Cologne, Germany under the directorship of Prof. Jeff Schell.<br>

                            My M.Sc. degree is in Zoology but for the past several years I have been working as a volunteer in Jaideep's lab. My work involves plant propagation, Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated, or biolistic transformation of Arabidopsis as well as molecular characterization of fluorescent-protein probes and transgenic plants. Our collaborative work has resulted in several publications related to "peroxisome motility in plants", "cloning & characterization of the ARP2/3 complex and EB1-like proteins", understanding rapid sub cellular responses and organelle extensions in plants.

                            <strong class="position">Post Doctoral scientist:2009-2010. Project- Organelle dynamics in plant growth and development</strong>
                            While studying for a Masters degree in molecular biology near Nainital, India I realized that lab was a fun place to be. Interest became addiction once I joined Dr Srinivasan&rsquo;s lab for a PhD program where I generated and screened a promoter trap collection of Arabidopsis lines for tissue specific promoters. The project was aimed at improvement of Brassica which is one of the mandate crops at National Center for Plant Biotechnology, NewDelhi, India. As a postdoctoral fellow, I also had the opportunity to work with Prof. V.Sundaresan, University of California, Davis on analyzing flanking sequence from transposon tagged lines of rice. During my life at Davis I developed an interest in protein trafficking and worked with Prof. Steve Theg trying to quantify the energy requirement  in terms of ATP currency for protein transport into chloroplast.  From then on, organelle behavior and activity has been of considerable interest to me resulting in brief stints of membrane protein targeting studies in the labs of Dr. Inoue and Prof. Mullen. I joined the Mathur lab in March 2009 and since then I have been studying with great interest the vibrant activity inside living cells using multicolored fluorescent-tagged proteins and advanced microscopic tools. I am interested in using cell biology as well as genetic tools to comprehend the ongoing interaction between intracellular organelles, their role in cellular behavior and the eventual transition into plant morphogenesis in response to internal as well as environmental cues.

                            <p>After completing a 3-year degree in Biotechnology at Seneca College, I decided to come to Guelph to develop my understanding of molecular and cellular biology. While working on an undergraduate research project in Molecular Biology and Genetics, I developed a profound interest in molecular processes and signal transduction research.                           <br>I joined the Mathur lab to complete a M.Sc. because of the focus the lab places on studying fundamental cellular biology using highly advanced tools.                           <br>My research is centered on live cell imaging by utilizing fluorescent probes and cutting edge microscopy technologies. Currently, I am studying the dynamics of key cellular components involved in the desiccation tolerant bryophyte <em>Tortula ruralis</em> during dehydration / rehydration states.

                            While presently completing my undergraduate studies in Plant Biotechnology at the University of Guelph, I have joined the Mathur lab in May 2009 for a lab research project. The numerous plant, cellular, and molecular courses that I have completed during the last few years have made it possible for me to join this lab and gain experience in live-imaging of plants. My research focuses on understanding exocytosis/endocytosis mechanisms during plant growth and development. The work involves <em>Arabidopsis </em>mutants of the "distorted trichome" class. The majority of my studies involve the use of electron microscopy to observe ultrastructural components of cells as well as confocal microscopy to acquire corresponding time-lapse images of organelles highlighted using different fluorescent protein probes.

                            In 2006 I began my undergraduate degree, here at the University of Guelph, studying Microbiology, and am currently entering my fourth year of study. Although my focus of study is microbes, my interest was drawn to plants in my third year when I had decided to take a few botany courses, including Plant Phisiology, a course instructed by Dr. Jaideep Mathur and Dr. Joseph Colasanti. Through the course of the semester we studied a myriad of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants and my interest grew. I am now working through the summer, using advanced molecular and cell biological tools, to assist in classifying the rapid and relative responses of peroxisomes and mitochondria to oxidative stress, and will continue this in the winter semester of 2010 in my fourth year research project.

                            I joined the Mathur lab in 2008 soon after taking a course on Plant growth and development. My work focuses on the analysis of different Arabidopsis thaliana mutants in the actin regulating ARP2/3 complex. I combine genetic studies on the mutants with physiological observations involving nutrient status and growth regulator effects. I am also involved in creating new sub-cellular targeted live-imaging probes for plants.
